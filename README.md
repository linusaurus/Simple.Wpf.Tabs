Simple.Wpf.Tabs
===============

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/db6cyf2xksk6sc4o/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oriches/simple-wpf-tabs/branch/master)

As with all my 'important' stuff it builds using the amazing [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oriches/simple-wpf-tabs).


Okay this is *opinionated software* on the way to build a tabbed UI in an MVC based architect implemented in WPF using MVVM as the flavour of MVC.

The reason for this existing is not because it doesn't already exist but I've had to look at so many implementations and come to the conclusion most are frankly not fit-for-purpose. They do the job but they make the developers life hell when trying to a new tab or modify how the tabs work. I want to understand how *I would do it* and if I could keep it to the bare minimum of functionality.
